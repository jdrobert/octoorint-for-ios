# OctoPrint for iOS and watchOS
This is a client app for [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org), a server that puts a really nice web interface between you and your 3D printer. 

I've noticed that there are a lot of OctoPrint apps for iOS where each one has a feature that I like but all of them seem broken in some way. Hopefully this app will work for me as well as others. 

The app is early in development and pretty barebones right now. My intended feature list is below and will be updated as I get things done. 

## Planned features
- **iOS**
    - [ ] Job progress widget
    - [x] Detect and setup OctoPrint instances on the network
    - [x] Connect to printer
    - [ ] Display current job progress 
    - [ ] Set hotend and bed temperatures
    - [ ] Start job
    - [ ] View webcam feed
- **watchOS**
    - [ ] Job progress complication
    - [ ] Display current job progress
    - [ ] Set predifined hotend and bed temperatures
    - [ ] Start job if file has been loaded
    - [ ] View stills from webcam
